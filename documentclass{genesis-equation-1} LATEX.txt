\section{Introduction}

The Genesis Equation presents two Equations for Genesis.

\[e = f f^{-1} no p\]
\[e = imm.\]
\[e \rightarrow f\]

\textbf{The Equation :}

\[e \rightarrow f \rightarrow imm \rightarrow ce \rightarrow cf \rightarrow cp \rightarrow mantle \rightarrow ceta \rightarrow ceta \rightarrow hover \rightarrow float \rightarrow\] 
\[ boundary-water \leftarrow transitionary-limit \rightarrow water-boundary\]
\[-magmus-solar-is-solar-magmus-\]
\[nebula-is-clear\]
\[\Rightarrow flat-organism \rightarrow neuro(lim, grth) \rightarrow\] 
\[\rightarrow mass \rightarrow sweat \{NxN\} \rightarrow multi \rightarrow man\] 
\[\rightarrow substance \rightarrow Settlement\] 
\[\rightarrow Pong-to-Earth (x-x)\] 
\[[Convergent-Point \{NxNxNxN\} z]\]

The equation is best described as a story.
\vfill
E was a curious explorer who wanted to discover the secrets of the universe. He had a device that could transform any input into a function, and he named it F. He also had a constant companion, Imm, who was a robot with a fixed value of 42.

\[e \rightarrow f \rightarrow imm\] 

One day, E decided to use F to create a function that would take him to the center of the earth. He typed in some expressions that he thought would work, and F returned a function named Mantle. E activated Mantle, and he and Imm were transported to the crust of the earth.

\[e \rightarrow f \rightarrow imm \rightarrow ce \rightarrow cf \rightarrow cp \rightarrow mantle\]

There, they encountered a strange creature that looked like a combination of a whale and a dolphin. It introduced itself as Ceta, and said that it was the guardian of the earth's core. It asked E and Imm what they were doing there, and E explained that he wanted to see the core. Ceta said that he would allow them to do so, but only if they could solve a riddle. He said that he had another function named Ceta, and that they had to find out what was the difference between the two functions.

\[e \rightarrow f \rightarrow imm \rightarrow ce \rightarrow cf \rightarrow cp \rightarrow mantle \rightarrow ceta \rightarrow ceta \]

E and Imm agreed to the challenge, and Ceta gave them a clue. He said that the difference was related to the parameters of the functions. E and Imm used F to analyze the two functions, and they realized that the first Ceta function took one parameter, Ocea, while the second Ceta function took one parameter, Ocean. They guessed that the difference was the spelling of the parameter names, and Ceta confirmed that they were right. He congratulated them, and said that he would take them to the core.

\[e \rightarrow f \rightarrow imm \rightarrow ce \rightarrow cf \rightarrow cp \rightarrow mantle \rightarrow ceta \rightarrow ceta \rightarrow hover \rightarrow float \rightarrow\] 

Ceta used his own function to transport E and Imm to the core of the earth. There, they saw a huge ball of fire that was hotter than the sun. Ceta explained that this was the source of the earth's energy and gravity, and that it was also a portal to other dimensions. He said that he could use another function, named Hover, to make them float near the core, or another function, named Float, to make them float at the surface of the core. E and Imm chose to float near the core, and they marveled at the sight.
 
\[ boundary-water \leftarrow transitionary-limit \rightarrow water-boundary\]

Ceta then asked them if they wanted to see another dimension. He said that he had a function, named Boundary-water, that could take them to the transitionary-limit of water, where water could exist in all three states: solid, liquid, and gas. He also said that he had another function, named Water-boundary, that could take them back to the transitionary-limit of earth, where they came from. E and Imm agreed to see the other dimension, and Ceta used Boundary-water to take them there.

\[-magmus-solar-is-solar-magmus-\]

There, they saw a world that was covered in water, with icebergs, oceans, and clouds. Ceta explained that this was the dimension where water was the dominant element, and that it was also a portal to other dimensions. He said that he could use another function, named Magmus-solar, to make them solar magmus, which was a form of energy that could travel through space and time. He also said that he had another function, named Nebula, that could make them clear, which was a form of matter that could blend in with any environment. E and Imm chose to become solar magmus, and they felt a surge of power.

\[nebula-is-clear\]

Ceta then asked them if they wanted to see another dimension. He said that he had a function, named Flat-organism, that could take them to the flat-earth, where the earth was a flat plane with no curvature. He also said that he had another function, named Neuro, that could take them to the prefrontal lim, where the prefrontal cortex was the most developed part of the brain. E and Imm agreed to see the other dimension, and Ceta used Flat-organism to take them there.

\[\Rightarrow flat-organism \rightarrow neuro(lim, grth) \rightarrow\] 

There, they saw a world that was flat and simple, with no mountains, valleys, or oceans. Ceta explained that this was the dimension where the earth was the simplest form of matter, and that it was also a portal to other dimensions. He said that he could use another function, named Mass, to make them tensor white mass, which was a form of matter that could bend space and time. He also said that he had another function, named Sweat, that could make them palm feet sweat, which was a form of matter that could secrete sweet substances. E and Imm chose to become tensor white mass, and they felt a twist of reality.

\[\rightarrow mass \rightarrow sweat \{NxN\}

Ceta then asked them if they wanted to see another dimension. He said that he had a function, named Multi, that could take them to the multiverse, where there were infinite universes with different possibilities. He also said that he had another function, named Man, that could take them to the boundary-third-mega mess man, where the man was the most chaotic form of life. E and Imm agreed to see the other dimension, and Ceta used Multi to take them there.

\[\rightarrow mass \rightarrow sweat \{NxN\} \rightarrow multi \rightarrow man\] 

There, they saw a world that was infinite and complex, with different universes that had different laws of physics, logic, and magic. Ceta explained that this was the dimension where the multiverse was the most diverse form of existence, and that it was also a portal to other dimensions. He said that he could use another function, named Substance, to make them boundary-third-mega water substance, which was a form of substance that could grab and grasp anything. He also said that he had another function, named Settlement, that could make them visionary settlement, which was a form of substance that could create and destroy anything. E and Imm chose to become visionary settlement, and they felt a burst of creativity.

\[\rightarrow substance \rightarrow Settlement\]

Ceta then asked them if they wanted to see another dimension. He said that he had a function, named Settlement, that could take them to the settlement, where there was nothing but their own imagination. He also said that he had no other function, and that this was the final destination. E and Imm agreed to see the other dimension, and Ceta used Settlement to take them there.

\[\rightarrow Pong-to-Earth (x-x)\] 

There, they saw a world that was nothing but their own imagination. Ceta explained that this was the dimension where they could create and destroy anything they wanted, and that it was also the end of their journey. He said that he was proud of them, and that he hoped they enjoyed their adventure. He also said that he would leave them alone, and that they could stay as long as they wanted. E and Imm thanked him, and said that they had a lot of fun. Ceta smiled, and said goodbye. He then disappeared, leaving E and Imm alone in their own world.
